#Lab13 - Graphs

- Program generates a simple Graph based on Node relations
- After initialization, output code is copied to clipboard, so it can 
be pasted on site
- If there is no input array, generates distances between Nodes

---
Here's the output from site: 

![Alt text](outputs/output.png?raw=true "Generated graph output 1")


---
Update: Added generation of multiple connections between Nodes 

TODO: Optimize connections

---
Update: Fixed some relations between Nodes, so node won't connect twice
 to the same node and it won't connect to itself
